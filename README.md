# Dental Disease Detection using ResNet

## Problem Statement
To develop a ResNet-based automated dental disease detection system to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce examination time.

---

## Dataset

- 100+ clinical dental images and X-rays collected
- Images anonymized and structured
- Dataset expansion in progress (Target: 1000+ images)

Due to dataset size and privacy considerations, the full dataset is hosted on Google Drive.
